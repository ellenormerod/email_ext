# Chrome Extension

This extension is for when I am are interested in emailing a friend the current link I am on.
When the extension is clicked it opens a new tab in gmail with a compose mail form that has the subject line prefilled and the body of the message has the link in it. 

Intent behind it was to make my own basic chrome extension.

This was greatly helped by https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/samples "Email this page".
